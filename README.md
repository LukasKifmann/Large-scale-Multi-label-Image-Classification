# Large-scale-Multi-label-Image-Classification

This repository provides a framework for large-scale multi-label image classification using Graph Convolutional Networks.
It is largely based on the paper [Multi-label image recognition with graph convolutional networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03582).

The code was written for the use in the experiments that were conducted for the bachelors thesis Probabilistic Semi-automatic Image Labelling based on Deep Learning Methods.
